## Problem Statement 🚧
Open Innovation : <br>
Smart ideas should not be limited by tracks. Feel free to open your heart out and develop something amazing.
 
 
### Inspiration 🔥
During pride month, where peaceful pride parades were ridiculed and bashed online, the illusion of safe space for the community has been lifted.
Hence, this project, for people won’t be name-called and harassed just for being themselves.

 
## About Our project 🔧
- MAPS / REVIEWS : This app culminates the safest and best places to the likes and needs of its users.
     Locations color coded for better visibility, like red for danger and green for safe.
- LOCAL COMMUNITY CHAT : This feature of Connect+ bring like minded people together. Old members of the LGBT community can support and guide people questioning their identity and help them give a safe space without shame or harassment.
- PERSONAL DMs: A private way to connect to people. This feature gives its user the privilege to be vulnerable with their closest community members.
 
 
## PLAN OF ACTION 🚨
On connect+, people from around the world can come, connect and talk to each other, tell about their surroundings and post stuff.
 
 
## How we built it 🔧
 
Our solution uses a basic firebase backend to integrate the chat and post feature. It also helps make friends and connect to the people of the same community.
 
## Tech Stack 🔨
1. Flutter
2. Dart
3. Git
4. GitHub
 
## Challenges we ran into 🏃♂️
 
1. `Map to Globe` was down for about 24 hours since the start of the hackathon, and looking for alternatives that could suffice our solution was a big challenge. 
 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of 🏅
1. Data encryption and privacy.
2. Data collection for location reviews.
3. Differentiate between genuine users and trolls.
4. Finding an API for the Map feature.

 
## What we learned 🧠
1. Learnt the integration of Maps in flutter.
2. End-to-end encryption for the chats.
 
## What's next ⏭
 For future additions we would like to make the location priority more accurate using some ML model.
